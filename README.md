# DONE Final Project

Hosted on fly.io at: https://done-app.fly.dev/

Do you struggle with staying organized and completing your to-do list? If so, you're not alone. Many people struggle to remember their daily tasks, especially when they have a long list of items to complete. Weâ€™ve created a new solution for this, in the form of a todo list application that uses pictures to mark tasks as done. This innovative application offers a unique and easy-to-use approach to task management, allowing you to easily capture completed tasks by taking pictures. You can now keep track of your daily tasks in a fun and efficient way, while easily identifying which tasks are completed and which ones still require attention. Even more, you can track your progress over time through pictures. Say goodbye to boring task lists and hello to a more interactive and visually appealing way of getting things done!
